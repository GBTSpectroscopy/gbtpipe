The `gbtpipe` package is a package for reducing and mapping On-the-fly mapping data created at the GBT in spectral line observations.  The module consists of two main components:

     * An installable version of the the GBTpipeline which is forked from NRAO's [gbt-pipeline](https://github.com/nrao/gbt-pipeline) package.
     * An On-the-fly gridding package that builds scan data into spectral line data cubes.
